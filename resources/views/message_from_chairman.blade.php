            <h1>Message From Chairman</h1>
            <p>
              After the liberation war, the health sector of Bangladesh was 
              completely deprived due to various political instability and uncertainity. 
              Unfortunately a significant number of people of this country died on that 
              time only because of incomplete diagnosis of disease and lack of better treatment. 
              When the sufferings were beyond the limit, at that time we established Popular Diagnostic 
              Centre Ltd. in Elephant Road, Dhaka. Our goal was to ensure modern treatment facilities for 
              the mass people of the country. 
          </p>

           Lifeline started its journey in June 1983 and within few days due to its accuracy of the reports 
            and quality of the service Popular became an unparallel symbol of reliability and trust from the end 
            of respective doctors and the people of our country.
          </p>

            To meet the demand of the respective doctors we ensured a modern setup of latest high-tech 
            machineries one after another for complete diagnosis of patients with utmost accuracy. Popular 
            Diagnostic is the first 
            private organization which ensured world latest medical equipments and technology in this country.
          </p>

            of the country at an affordable cost. This will definitely 
            reduce the burden of the government and will make the path of "Health for all" more smooth and effective.
